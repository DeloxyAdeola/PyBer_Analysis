# PyBer_Analysis 
The overview of this project is to give Visuaize a clear analysis on the business goal based on rider sharing and the progress and challenges in different types of cities like the Urban, Suburban and the Rural citiess. also in a way to see how ridesharing has been in these areas and to promotes ride sharing, make it affordable in neigbouhood that as less privileged
I retrieved my data from CSV file, checked for missing values and errors before analyzing my data to ge the right output. 
Witht the types of cities and how populated they seem to be, the graph observation is not suprising. 
In Avearage terms, we can see that rural Drivers out performed Suburban and Urban drivers.
Urban cities generated the most income for Pyber followed by Suburban and Rural. 
In the later days in the Month of Feb, there was increase in all city types, should we liking that to the facts that the weather woould have restricted people from driving. 

In colusion.
Urban cities generate the most revenue for PyBer
Customers in Urban cities pay less per ride and therefore drivers earn less per ride
The Rural areas seem to have shortage of this servcies thereby making fares expensive than that of the Urban and Suburban cities, and also the fact that its a lesser polulated city, they will have lesser drivers commuting those arreas and customers in those areas face more expensive fares than in Urban or Suburban cities.

3. Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
In order to reduce the disparity between Urban, Suburban and Rural cities, we recomend the following:

Rather than focusing on just the first third of the year, the study may gain from having extra data points that span the entire year and provide insights into yearly trends.
It seems like the Rural cities are underserved, but it would be neccesary to perform a market study to confirm if there is enough demand in this market segment to justify investing in hiring more drivers.
Based on the relationship of Urban cities of 2405 Drivers/1625 Rides = 1.48 Drivers/Ride, the total number of drivers in Rural areas shold be increased at least to 185 (78 drivers * 1.48 = 185 drivers), but this increase has to be supported by a market study, as explained in #2
Using the same metric as in #3 above, the number of drivers in Suburban cities should be increased to a minimum of 726.
I also believe that thr CEO should give disconts to the Rural cities since they are less privileged and find themselves spending more on ride sharing. The comapny is already generating a mouth watering income from the Urban and suburban cities. it would be great if this sugesstion can be put into consideration.
